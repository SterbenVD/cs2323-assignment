# Risc-V Disassembler
Repo for my assignment for the course CS2323 (Computer Architecture) at IITH.

Name: Vishal Vijay Devadiga
Roll Number: CS21BTECH11061

Language of Program: C++
Compile the program using g++

Input should be kept in a file called "input.txt" in the same folder.
This generates a file "output.txt" which has the dissassembled code.

NOTE: Please trim the input. If spaces exist with the hex code, the code gives an error.
