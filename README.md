# Risc-V Disassembler
Repo for my assignment for the course CS2323 (Computer Architecture) at IITH.

Input should be kept in a file called "input.txt" in the same folder.
This generates a file "output.txt" which has the dissassembled code.

NOTE: Please trim the input. If spaces exist with the hex code, the code gives an error.
